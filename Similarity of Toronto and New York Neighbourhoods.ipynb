This will allow them to explore the different neighbourhhods and give them an idea of which neighbourhoods would be suitable for them to move to based on how similar they are to where they currently reside. It will also allow a general sense of how similar the two cities are and whether emigrating would be the right option for them. \n\nThe project will utilise Unsupervised Machine Learning using K-Means clustering to cluster similar neighbourhoods in both Toronto and New York based on the venues in their proximity."

Any categorical variables will be encoded using One Hot Encoding and then the data will be standardised to ensure the attributes are weighted fairly. The data will be combined using the relevant criteria in order to allow the neighbourhoods to be compared and clustered based on their similarities in terms of venues. This will then be visualised to allow the analysis and learnings to be easily understood and evaluated to allow comparisons of neighbourhoods in both Toronto and New York. "
